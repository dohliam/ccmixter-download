# ccmixter-download-artist - A tool for batch downloading songs from ccmixter

There is a lot of great open-licensed music on [ccMixter](http://ccmixter.org/), but it isn't very easy to download all tracks uploaded by a particular artist. This script allows you to download songs and stream entire playlists by specifying the artist name.

## Usage

    ccmixter_download_artist.rb [ARTIST] [OPTIONS]

## Options
* `-d`: _download all tracks_
* `-f`: _save urls to tracklist_
* `-h`: _show this help_
* `-p`: _print tracklist_
* `-s`: _stream entire playlist (requires mplayer)_
